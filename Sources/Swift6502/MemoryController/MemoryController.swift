// A grand title, but this is not an MMU.
// It abstracts the memory allowing us to redirect I/O or trap reads and writes to specific locations.
//
// Reads and writes do use emulated physical memory to access values. It's off limits to the CPU, so
// should be OK.
//
// The read callback returns an optionl which should be used in preference to memory if valid.
// The write callback has a return value. This will typically bethe value passed in, but it could
// be mangled by the callback, in which case write the mangled value rather than the passed in one.
