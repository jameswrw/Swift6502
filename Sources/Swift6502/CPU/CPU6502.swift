// CPU6502 has a small public interface, but testing wants to poke around with internals.
// This is an issue because you end up with zillions of concurrency warnings. Fixing them
// would be fine, but you seem to need to write accessors that are *only* used by testing.
// e.g.
//  #expect(cpu.X == 0x12)
//
// This produces errors and you end up needing to write something like:
//  let x = await cpu.X
//  #expect(x == 0x12)
//
// Setting values is worse:
//  await cpu.setX(0x34)
//
// becomes:
// await cpu.setX(0x34)
//
// Where setX() is *only* used in testing. All other access to X is within the actor,
// so ordinarily setX() is not needed.
//
// Setting memory via MemoryController is peak awful:
//  cpu.memory[0x1234] = 12
//
// becomes:
//  await cpu.setMemory(address: 0x1234, value: 0x42)
//
// Again, the access function is only used by tests, and it results in harder to read code that won't
// be used anywhere else. This seems a waste of time.
//
// The best I came up with for testing is to make this a class before running the tests.
